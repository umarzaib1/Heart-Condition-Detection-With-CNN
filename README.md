# Heart-Condition-Detection-With-CNN

Heart Condition (Normal / Abnormal) Detection using Deep Learning CNN
This project focuses on building a Deep Learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to detect heart conditions (Normal/Abnormal) from image data. The trained model can then be utilized in a desktop application for practical use.

Project Plan
The project follows a structured approach consisting of the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load the image dataset, organize it into training and testing sets, and perform necessary preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
Model Building: Design and implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suitable for image classification.
Model Training: Train the CNN model on the prepared dataset, monitoring its performance during training.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Saving: Save the trained model for later use in the desktop application.
Dataset
The processed image dataset used for this project can be accessed from the following Google Drive link:
